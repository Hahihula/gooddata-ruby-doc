title: Computing Dataset’s Number of Records
---

Problem
-------

Very often there is a need to know how many records there are in a
dataset.

Solution
--------

This is not so easy to do on UI. You basically have to find the
dataset’s connection point and then create a simple report with COUNT
metric. SDK makes this very simple task.
