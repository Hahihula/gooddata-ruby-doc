Problem
-------

You would like to use folders for organizing your project’s model

Solution
--------

By default all the attributes and facts are automatically assigned a
folder based on it’s dataset name. This name is either generated from
the dataset’s name or title (if defined). You can override this default
and specify your own folder for any field.



Discussion
----------

Folders are not removed. If you would publish a model that doesn’t
contain an existing folder, the folder isn’t automatically removed (it
is empty).
