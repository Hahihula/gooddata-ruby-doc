Goal
-------

You moved an attribute in your model and you would like to change the
identifier for it to follow the naming convention.

How-to
--------

You can change the identifier on any object (e.g. dashboards, reports,
metrics, attributes, facts etc.). Many tools rely on specific LDM object
identifier’s naming convention. So changing the identifier may be very
handy for for enforcing the naming convention. For example when you move
an attribute from one dataset to another, you may want to change its
identifier.
