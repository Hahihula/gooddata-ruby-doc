How to contribute to GoodData Ruby SDK
--------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself we can ignore when we pull)
* run `rake test` and make sure all tests pass
* run `rake cop` and make sure you did not introduce any new coding rules issues
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
